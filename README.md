Project Description:

RMS (Restaurant Management System) is a desktop-based application. The system will enable restaurant managers to manage employees, make new or edit an existing menu. The managers will also be able to monitor the orders placed by the specific employees at the restaurant. The system will allow employees to place orders, receive cash and print bills. The system will use the remote database which will also enable the manager to see order history.
